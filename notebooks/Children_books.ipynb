One minute he seems interested in her and she feels they have a connection\\u00a0 - but the next, he avoids her and acts as if he hardly knows her.\\nWhen he saves her life, she finally discovers his secret and all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. Anna realises they should never have been able to meet, let alone fall in love, because although he is a year older than her, Bennett was born in the year she turned 16.\\u00a0\\nThis compelling time-travel adventure in the tradition of\\u00a0The Time Traveller's Wife will appeal to young fans of romance.

Once you've covered reading and writing music, and getting the timing right, you reach the best bit: having fun making a wonderful sound!\\nAccompanying a chatty text, clean, sharp ice-cream coloured graphics make complex concepts incredibly clear, with musical samples to download and activities to stimulate responses and deepen understanding. Wise, inspiring and innovative, this introduction is underpinned by great depth and breadth of expertise.\\u00a0\",\n          \"Lou Brown's swimming ambitions sank without trace when she failed in the Olympic time trials that sent her best friend off to High Performance Training Camp.\\nFifteen years old, 5 foot 10 (and still growing), left at home with no hobby and no friend, she struggles to fit in with even the least cool kids at school. When an accidental encounter leads to her coaching three of the coolest guys around in their quest to get on TV, Lou finds her life descending into chaos and craziness.\\nWith plenty of genuine laugh-out-loud moments and a zany plot, Lou's story is a hilarious, yet poignant, exploration of the highs and lows of navigating teenage relationships and social expectations.
